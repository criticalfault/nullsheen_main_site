      <description>Books Used in this article. SR3 Core Mr. Johnson&amp;rsquo;s Little Black Book Shadowrun is a game about high risk and high rewards. Too often we however only see rewards of nuyen. Some Gamemasters stretch their legs and add in things like extra contacts or some exotic ammos, but when was the last time you had something like a program, spell or exotic material for resale? Each of those rewards can lead to more stories and more stories is ALWAYS better!</description>

      <description>Books Useful for this article. Magic In The Shadows SR3 Core Street Wyld One of the things a lot of people may overlook in Shadowrun is how spells are purchased/learned in game. I think it&amp;rsquo;s very important to understand that mages and shamans need to get access to either teachers or buying formulas. This can also be an excellent opportunity to bring in new NPCs and teachers. In most games I see a lot of people just spend the karma and poof!</description>

      <description>After doing a lot of thinking about this little side project of mine, I had decided I perhaps needed to begin to supplement the cost of this website/hosting for tools/investment of time. I hate to make any kind of clutter or cause anyone any strife when it comes to reading my articles, using my tools, or just generally enjoying the spirit of the reason my site exists. However, seeing the cost continue to rise, I will need to come up with something.</description>

      <description>Books Used in this article. Magic In The Shadows SR3 Core I&amp;rsquo;ve always been drawn to various faiths as I grew up. What people believed and why was always so interesting to me. Being able to walk into a new church, temple or holy place and seeing the customs, hearing the music and enjoying lessons the faiths had. I tend to gravitate towards character concepts that have faith as their foundation.</description>

      <description>This is a scrape from the https://www.shadowrunrpg.com site for ALL of their Erratas. They seem to have kind of let this go to seed and I know a TON of people are looking for this.

      <description>The New Ghost Busters - RPG using Shadowrun 3rd Edition Around 20 years ago I fell in love with a franchise I thought was dead. It was funny, it was spooky and it was wierd. I was never the same after seeing Ghostbusters for the first time. I too wanted to hold back the darkness with my wit and genius. Fighting with the heart of a lion against what goes bump in the night.</description>

      <description>Vehicle Chases Vehicle chases have always been a thorn in my side since I started playing Shadowrun. I’ve always wanted that cinematic experience of the PCs&amp;rsquo; vehicles skittering down a road while gangers chase them, dragging chains through the streets. This has never been really successfully done. So many attempts, so many times I tried to figure out the chase TNs.&#xA;So this is my attempt to fix it so you can make chase TNs and Scenes that will make your players sit on the edge of their seat.</description>

      <description>As we spoke about before, Covid really threw our lives when it came to game into some strangeness. We had to spin up new methods of keeping our stories alive. Though this is my least favorite of the ways to run a game. It holds itself aloft as something that can bring people together from across the world to enjoy the stories of friends who cannot gather around a table. Though in a more modern adaptation.</description>

      <description>We have another Zine that blazed trails in the Shadowrun universe! Started by Jerry Stratton and continued by Tony Moller. This along with the Shadowrun Supplemental were among the first player published materials out there. The first issue came out in 1992 and the last in 1994.&#xA;As these are free to distribute I wanted to ensure it had a place among the archive of everything else Shadowrun had to offer for those who may have missed the boat so to speak on these wonderful publications.</description>

      <description>On January 1st, 1992 we were given Shadowrun in its second form. Now revised with an attempt to bring the systems together and resolve some rules disputes, this gave us the form Shadowrun would exist in for some time. In 1997 Adam Jury rounded up some articles and put together the first Shadowrun Supplemental. This was a collection of articles written by players and Game Masters about topics they wanted to see in their games.</description>

      <description>After doing some digging into character sheets for an up and coming game. I suddenly realize the crap shoot that was finding character sheets for Shadowrun. On one hand, it makes sense. The IP has been shared and scattered to the winds across half a dozen companies all keeping their own digital presence. On the other, we used to have things like dumpshock.org to keep us with what we needed. Nowadays, well it&amp;rsquo;s a whole different ball game.</description>

The games that we wanted to play with our friends suddenly had to move online. Separated from our friends and unable to share a table, we turned to the tools that were made for online play. The real problem here is, most things were made for DnD.</description>

In this system we are going to introduce multiple nodes. Each node itself will have its own security sheaf. Each system will be marked with a letter and its Sheaf will be added in a table next to its letter. A new rule you will need to pick up as well is that security tally carries as the decker moves between different subsystems.</description>

      <description>Books Used in this article. Matrix Target: Matrix SR3 Core A lot of cyberpunk revolves around crazy new technology. In almost every system imaginable, this includes some kind of virtual reality system that people have become obsessed with. Part of this is due to the escape it offers. A paradise outside of the nightmare society has wrought with shifting laws to allow for hyper capitalism. Regardless of why, it leads to characters who want to enter this world and most importantly, take on the counter cultural heroes known as Hackers, Deckers, Phreakers or the likes.</description>

      <description>A long long time in a galaxy far far away, any kind of shadowrun content was gold. It was rare and beautiful to behold. Decker was one of those nuggets from the era. It was difficult, but getting ahead was extremely satisfying. This of course led to save scumming like never before! All of this said, it was written in an era of windows that has since passed, but just like everything these days.</description>

Currently it is configured to instantly remove initiative as they take damage. This is how my table plays however I realize a lot of others may not. I will make a toggle in the future which will remove this feature for tables that don&amp;rsquo;t play with it.</description>

      <description>After seeing various sites I used to rely on disappearing day by day, I have grown nostalgic about the various programs i had used through out the years. As I have seen new players dig for resources for them to come up empty it has sparked my own interest in tossing my hat into the ring. I of course cannot promise I will suceed in some of these plans that seeing this data has given me, but what I can promise, is getting the data into a place for it to be preserved for the future.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of tools I used growing up and trying to learn Shadowrun. The few that always made me happiest were the ones that really gave me the fully control and customization that Shadowrun allows. People at FASA really dug into the idea that characters will want signature weapons/vehicles/spells/etc. That being a major part of who they are meant we needed that DEEP control over who and what they were.</description>

      <description>Books Used in this article. Matrix Target: Matrix SR3 Core Awhile ago we had need for a good security generator. I know there have been quite a few, and I checked on an old one that I used to use, and the hosting was going out on it. I took a lot of the concepts and rolled them into a new React project. It goes a bit above and beyond for it most of what was there.</description>

      <description>Starting Fresh After doing a lot of game play for a group of friends and getting back into the community at large. I (and some friends) have decided to make a space for tools and things we have ended up writing for the Shadowrun (2nd and 3rd) systems. This will start out pretty small, but hopefully will have a lot of helpful stuff for people in need for tools for randomization or just in need of being able to put together systems for their games.</description>
