I've put together as many books as I can scouring Amazon (And soon I hope Noble Knights for some rarer titles) to help you get what you are looking for. These are affiliate links, so buying items through this page does help me. So I thank you in advanced if you do end up finding something.

## General Items I recommend
 - [Dice Cubes](https://amzn.to/3WKnmO3)
  - This is what I've always used and will always recommend for Shadowrun of any edition. There is enough dice for you to always be able to meet your pool size in just one brick.
 - [Uptime Energy Drink](https://amzn.to/4dPrUZC)
  - Most of this site was built while sipping on one of these. They are the only energy drink i've had that don't give me that feeling of being overly caffinated. Awake, alert and focused. Great product.
