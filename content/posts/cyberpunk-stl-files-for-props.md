**STL Files for Shadowrun and Cyberpunk (Red or otherwise)**

So my table is pretty extreme when it comes to making props and cityscapes. We just love being drawn in by massive 3d print builds and honestly, once you know where to look, it mostly comes down to time. The cost of these things is pretty tiny in the long run. $100 of filament can go a LONG freaking way. 

So I wanted to put together a list of stuff we used to print out the mega city that we play in. We are currently playing a Cyberpunk RED Trauma team game and I’ve just finished up running Brain Scan in Shadowrun, but now starting my Lonestar Game in order to continue to write my storylines and SOON my books to be published as HoloStreets (for 3rd & 5th Edition). 

I’ve broken these down sections for each thing. All of them are things we printed in FDM (PLA Plastics). I have a few shots for the city we are currently playing in with some “As we made it” photos as well.

Here is the big list! Everything on this list is free with the exception of those that are linked to DriveThruRPG. I'll mark the paid ones so you can skip them if you desire.

## Terrain
When it comes to Terrain, the Modern Urban Streets and Sidewalks is where to start. Aether Studios has done a great job to allow for easy street building. We have printed more than a 100 of these. You can see in the build above how many we must have printed. So if you were interested in trying this, this is definitely the first thing to buy and start printing out!

The rest of these are scatter terrain for various environments. I can’t tell you how cool it feels to dive behind a dumpster and open up with your SMGs are some street toughs. It’s such a simple thing to print too but it REALLY goes a long way. Even unpainted it feels rad.

## Tokens
Tokens mostly used for Karma, Edge and Luck. Having something physical in a player's hand makes them feel it all the more when they spend it. Karma pools can get kind of crazy if you start getting in the 20s and 30s, but I just scaled the Karma Token up to x1.5 its size and use those as 5s. Then you can go a long way with them. They also end up costing like 0.07 or cents to print each one. So you can make a LOT of them for very cheap. Another thing we use is Access Points for where Deckers/Netrunners get pings for scans for various things.

## Props
As with the token discussions, having something physical in hand makes the game feel a LOT more interesting. For single printings for key objects it can REALLY push adventures forward. I use a lot of these in my games. It also gives a firm reminder that something exists which sometimes players forget about in the heated moments. I highly recommend the Shards in general. They come out pretty clean and are easy to paint different colors for different stuff.

- Eurobuck for printing
    - Printing money?! Yeah someone posted this on the Cyberpunk Subreddit and I tracked down a good copy for printing. Have fun throwing this stuff around! I’d recommend buying some heavier paper for it though.
    - [Printing Eddies](/images/Eurodollar.jpg)
- NetRunner Deck
    - We use this for every Cyberpunk Red Netrun. It does help a TON to be able to see what's going on. I highly recommend using [https://cybersmily.net/apps/rednet](https://cybersmily.net/apps/rednet) website for making Net Architecture on the fly. Cybersmily is the man!

## Cyberdecks
Turns out there is an underground movement to make Cyberdecks. This is of course SUPER crazy complicated, but it is pretty rad that it exists. Here is an example of a build: [https://thedigitalocean.wordpress.com/deck/](https://thedigitalocean.wordpress.com/deck/)

## Printers
If you don’t have a printer you may want a recommendation. What I can tell you is that we printed everything in the photos you saw on Ender 3s. I have a V2 though I’ve heard the V3s are definitely worth while to mess with too if you end up wanting to get the newest and best the Bambu is a freaking BEAST. It's a lot more expensive but its about 8 or so times faster.
