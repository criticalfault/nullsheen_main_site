[Enhance Travel Bag Adventurer](https://amzn.to/4bYT12U)

I have never written one of these product reviews, but as I understand it, this is how you make a successful blog: finding the best of the items for those who would actually use them. I thought perhaps I would start with something I use pretty often. So let's talk about the “ENHANCE Travel Bag”

I’m one of those people who have to own the books. I get that people love PDFs, but for me there is nothing better than a new gaming book for something I am running. In that respect of course, I tend to bring a bunch of my books with me to always be prepared. As it turns out, carrying a bunch of books is a huge pain. My wife and I looked all over and mostly I was using a backpack, but that tended to beat the heck out of my books. This was our alternative.

## So let's go over the good
I've had this thing for years now and i've loved it. It's always my go to when I run game outside of my house, especially when I need a few minis to make the adventure just a bit more awesome. I also tend to make a lot of extras for my characters. Currently I am playing a fast hands rogue, so I made a dozen different kinds of traps I can use in game and it's been great to move all of it.

### The brass fittings are hardcore. 
They are VERY strong. I’ve broken more than my fair share of backpack zippers, this thing I've used hundreds of times and it's not slowing down at all.

### Storage is solid for SR books. 
Hardcover or softcover, it will fit the core + every expansion most people bring with room to spare. (It measures 12.5 x 9.5 x 6 inches.)

### It has padded inserts
To keep your books from getting wrecked by your spiral notebooks. I’m a collector so it's a big deal to me that even the books I play with shouldn’t get damaged if I can help it. This helps me quite a bit.

### Fits an iPad no problem
I use my iPad to keep notes so this is always welcome. It also can be used to keep spiral notebooks apart from other books too, which is nice!

### Foam tray for minis. 
I play in quite a few different games (D&D, Shadowrun, Cyberpunk, etc). I throw all of my minis in this bad boy and it has room to spare.

### Extra pockets. 
I keep extra dice, smaller notepads, pens, pencils, dry erase markers, etc in this thing. Since it holds them all I'm usually Johnny on the spot for handing out stuff when people need it.

## Now the not so good
Nothing is perfect of course, though this has been very good. Here are the two things I ran into.

### Not waterproof. 
Definitely put your bottled water somewhere else if it's ice cold. I’ve had a problem or two with water bleeding through the pocket walls. I've left a water bottle in the side pouch and found it wet in other areas. So just make sure your careful with that.

### The strap pad can tear. 
This happened to me. I just need to have my wife unpack her sewing machine to repair it and I think it will be good, but I know it can happen. I also tend to load mine to “the bursting point”.

I honestly think my wife can patch this up. I'll see if i can get it repaired and let you guys know.

## Summary
All and all, I've really grown attached to this. I have been considering getting a second one in order to have bags packed for different games so I don't need to swap the books out of each. I’ve never had a reason to carry anything else to fit more stuff unless I am running something bigger for DnD. I have been looking at the “DM’s Backpack” however which holds a LOT more minis. So I may end up getting one of those (See if the extra $60 is worth it). If I do, look forward to a review on that!
