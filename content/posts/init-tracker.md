After some more requests for tools, I bring you all my initiative tracker. So far it is made for Shadowrun 2nd And 3rd Edition (With a simple toggle for each edition). Currently it is configured to instantly remove initiative as they take damage. This is how my table plays however I realize a lot of others may not. I will make a toggle in the future which will remove this feature for tables that don't play with it.

Some of the other features in the future planned is toggling the hit boxes in general, first edition initiative pass (base 7s instead of base 10 turn division). We will see if there are anymore suggestions as the tool get used. I really hope this makes your games easier.
