We have another Zine that blazed trails in the Shadowrun universe! Started by Jerry Stratton and continued by Tony Moller. This along with the Shadowrun Supplemental were among the first player published materials out there. The first issue came out in 1992 and the last in 1994. 

As these are free to distribute I wanted to ensure it had a place among the archive of everything else Shadowrun had to offer for those who may have missed the boat so to speak on these wonderful publications.

This kind of thing was one of the things that made Shadowrun feel alive in the 90s. Living publications that truly showed the Shadowrun passion was alive and well. Not to mention the bleeding edge was constantly being updated. Given these were unofficial handbooks, they made their way in thousands of games and even into more character generators at the time.

Something about getting your hands on these felt a lot like buying a mixtape off Cereal Killer of the Best Artists who asphyxiated on their own vomit. Something only the most passionate of souls could forge. As with all of my archives, I have ensured nothing is altered about them. They are with all copyrights to the makers/holders/etc. I want this to just be a pedestal for them to stand on. Nothing more.

They currently live here: [http://www.hoboes.com/pub/Role-Playing/Shadowrun/NAGEE/](http://www.hoboes.com/pub/Role-Playing/Shadowrun/NAGEE/). 

However, this site hasn't been updated in some time. I hope it stays with us, but others have begun to started to disappear, I hope this one sticks around!

However, in accordance with my own mission. They will also live here forever (Or at least until GitHub sinks into the swamp and something new and shiny replaces it).
