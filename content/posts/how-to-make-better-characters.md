I’ve always had an easy time coming up with different characters I wanted to play across the several dozen different systems my friends and I play. With it, I use the same system in my head to make them regardless of system, world, or requirements. I believe these 3 rules will help you make better, more compelling characters and give your GM enough fuel to craft better stories for you and ultimately your table.

1) Give your character a weakness.
2) Give your character a direct goal they are pursuing.
3) Give your character some gimmick

Beyond the basics of a character (Name, Background, Type), players often forget to make their character a person with morals, frailties and blind spots. One thing that makes characters more compelling to tell stories for is being able to place foils to get your characters engaged in the story. Since most players are enjoying the power fantasy of games, we sometimes forget that a lot of stories involve letting a character make a mistake in order to be pulled into their story.

Every GM wants to know at least one character will help their NPC, pick up their magical mcguffin or desire to walk into the basement to learn the secret to their story. Most of the time we players can see the telegraphed danger but we need to remember that the danger is inherent in their lives. This also can be something to work on and show character growth.

Having a direct goal also allows our GM to lay some groundwork for character and perhaps even your group. It gives you some sign posts to follow, as generally they will ensure that their story intertwines with your goal. These goals don’t need to be super complicated, but something direct enough that you will be able to make actionable steps forward. So something like “Become a more Powerful Wizard”, can be broken into steps like “Find more scrolls, encounter new spells, craft magical items, inspect new magical devices”. The real sticking point is that your character will go to great lengths to fulfill this goal and will put themselves in danger for an advancement to this goal.

Finally, a more memorable thing I always try to do is to come up with some kind of gimmick. Obviously do your best to make this something that isn’t designed to annoy anyone else at the table, but instead is used to clearly define your character. They should be something you can easily put into play at least once a session if not more. Often these are tied directly into your weakness or your goal.

Some of my favorites are:
- ”Uses Metaphors incorrectly”
- ”Speaks in 3rd Person”
- “Smokes like a Chimney”
- “Is always in a disguise”
- ”Lies about his social standing”
- ”Is always hungry”
- ”Has some trinket they can’t be without”
- “Is the eternal tourist of the land they now reside in”
- ”Is an adrenaline junkie”
- ”Loves animals”

Hopefully this will allow you to create some quick definitions for your characters and make them much more memoriable and in the end, easier to play.
