After doing a deep dive on researching old Shadowrun Programs (and I think I've decided to collect them all for mirrors) I stumbled onto an SR2 Character Creator. This was great for me because if I end up going down that road of making a character creator, I now have all of the base data files to extract the data and put it into a standard format (JSON in this case). 

Currently, if you are needing to look into these old files for your own needs. I've moved the repository over to [https://github.com/criticalfault/shadowrun-data](https://github.com/criticalfault/shadowrun-data). 

Finally, I've uploaded the files I have found to this site as well. [SRCG](/files/srcg.zip) and [SRCG28.zip](/files/srcg28a.zip). These seem to be old VB files, (VB 3? VBX). Run at your own risk, but i will say they are 16 bit applications. So I don't think you will have a ton of success with it. 

I am actively looking for more programs to preserve. Once I have a large collection of them, I will put together a public repo with them all in it and everything I can find with them. I love collecting old things like this. It makes my collector heart happy. I really hope these become useful for more people. As always, hit me up if you find anything worthwhile. I can be reached by email at Dean@ this domain.
