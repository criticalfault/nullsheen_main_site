After seeing various sites I used to rely on disappearing day by day, I have grown nostalgic about the various programs i had used through out the years. As I have seen new players dig for resources for them to come up empty it has sparked my own interest in tossing my hat into the ring. I of course cannot promise I will suceed in some of these plans that seeing this data has given me, but what I can promise, is getting the data into a place for it to be preserved for the future.

I hope some day when people are digging through git repos in the future, they can stumble upon the work that was done on these files to save themselves the hundred of hours of data entry and cross referencing. This should hopefully give anyone who wants to a great starting point for any of their projects.

The data can be found here: [https://github.com/criticalfault/sr3-data](https://github.com/criticalfault/sr3-data)

I have already processed around half of them, i'll continue to process the rest and get it ready for my next plans!
