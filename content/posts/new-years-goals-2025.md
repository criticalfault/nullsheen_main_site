Greetings Shadowpunks!

With last year behind us, I look forward to what will come in the future. This year I hope to finish two new tools for the site: Weapon Designer and Vehicle Designer. These will more than likely take at least 3 or 4 months each (Though the vehicle one will take something really special to finish in that time).  My hope is always to allow players more control over their characters and to give GMs the tools to be able to create custom things quickly and easily. I hope these will continue to help people make great games!

In keeping up with the yearly updates, the website traffic has been steadily increasing. So this means we are slowly approaching the threshold where the website is going to begin to pay for itself. It’s been a long road and I know I need to write several more reviews as well, I am hoping to hear from you good folks to hear what you are looking for. So please tell me what you would enjoy and I will do my best to get it setup for you!

Finally, the Archive is looking for Form Fillable 1st Edition character sheets. There have been some requests based on the new 1st edition reprint that I am hoping to be able to fulfill for those looking. Only you can help the other Shadowpunks out there looking to relive the first taste the world got of Shadowrun.

I look forward to another great year punks, let’s make it a good one.
