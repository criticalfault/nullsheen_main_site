While doing a lot of discussions with Pink Fohawk's discord led me down the road of needing to make a second edition matrix maker. Making a generator for something like this would be incredibly hard in the idea that systems have to be tailored to a specifically match the needs. of the system. Part of what I was thinking was building some specific payloads for the system builder to take in the more useful systems folks build.

Currently I am in my 0.5 verison of the system. It allows you to place and rate your nodes indivdually, save it off as well as load other json files of those same files. My next mark will be adding IC tokens. These you would be able to drag around and place on the system. This should allow for the system to be used during a run to keep track of things.
