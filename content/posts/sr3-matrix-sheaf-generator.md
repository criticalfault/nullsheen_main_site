Awhile ago we had need for a good security generator. I know there have been quite a few and I checked on an old one that i used to use and the hosting was going out on it. I took a lot of the concepts and rolled them into a new React project. It goes a bit above and beyond for it most of what was there. It gives rules and allows for some amount of tracking during a run. One thing i definitely want to consider is making a save/load feature.
