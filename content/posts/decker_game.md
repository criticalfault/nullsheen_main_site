A long long time in a galaxy far far away, any kind of shadowrun content was gold. It was rare and beautiful to behold. Decker was one of those nuggets from the era. It was difficult, but getting ahead was extremely satisfying. This of course led to save scumming like never before! All of this said, it was written in an era of windows that has since passed, but just like everything these days. A spark held in someones heart allowed it to step forward into the future.

[https://github.com/palparepa/decker](https://github.com/palparepa/decker) is the result of that held spark. I hope that with more folks taking a look into it, perhaps it can continue to burn. The original fire that spark was held in is here [https://sourceforge.net/projects/decker/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/decker/). These creations I think truly hold up to the test of time, as well as show off what decking was like in 2nd Edition Shadowrun. It's always been interesting to me how it appears as a kind of dungeon crawl.

I always wanted to try my own hand at making such a game. So many more came after this of course, but that was when tools and creation of such projects were signficantly easier than bare bones carving your game from nothing. Who knows, maybe some day I will. However, today I wanted to attempt to bring you something that brought wonder to me. I hope it does you.

So if you want a taste of that sweet decking action, to see how you would hold your own against the corporations and carve out a life for yourself in the cyberpunk future.
