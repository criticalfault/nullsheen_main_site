## Lone Star Campaign
For a long time ive had a desire to run a Lone Star game. I've always been a huge fan of police procedurals on TV and I thought i'd take a stab a writing a small campaign for it. I then had the idea of releasing these as episodic posts someone might be able to use for their own campaign.

That makes this first post a setup post with a few special rules. Some of these are modified directly out of the Lone Star book. It was a very good resources, but I think it could use for some more gamification on both sides of the law.

### Character Creation Special Rules


- Police Procedures
  - Skill allows the player to know what is expected of them and how to follow things within the limits of the law.
- Free CI at CG
  - Always level 1 and cannot be raised above that except by CRAZY circumstances.  Cannot be someone even remotely high up in any criminal empire at CG.
- Lose your Job, Lose your Life
  - Part of the limitations of this campaign is you cannot get fired. If you ARE fired or go to jail, you must retire your character.
- Chasing
	- Athletics rolls will be used often for foot chases.

### NPCs
The world is full of people on both sides of the line.

#### Friends of the Blue
- Captain Ashley (Ash) Grey - Leader of the Seattle Lonestar Precinct.

- Lt. Mark Stone - Cpt Grey's Right hand. Anytime Grey is too busy to handle something, Stone is the next in line.

- Lt. Ellen Asher - Cpt Grey's 'doom speaker'. If something needs to be said and no one has the guts to do it. Asher gets it done. 

- Emily Lawton - DA - Criminal Law 7, The best attorney the bench has to offer.

- Derrick Jennings - DA - Criminal Law 5, Thinks he is God's gift to the law.

- Lenny Scull - DA - Criminal Law 3, One of the last people you want on your side.

- Skip Tracer Randy - A great resource, though he is a squirrely as the day is long.
