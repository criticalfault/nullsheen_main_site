As we continue to march forward in reclaiming our past a few people stepped up and created tools for our future. One such person is [Lord Nago](https://www.reddit.com/user/LordNago/). 
He has created several pieces for a 2nd Edition Shadowrun Roll20 setup. With his permission i am making this post and hosting these files for him. Feel free to reach out to him on Reddit if you have questions or requests!

Here is his original post on Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowrun/comments/1bu2c8i/custom_sr2e_sheet_for_roll20/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowrun/comments/1bu2c8i/custom_sr2e_sheet_for_roll20/)

He also has some discussion here on his YouTube channel: [https://youtu.be/OUTC_YmGrZk](https://youtu.be/OUTC_YmGrZk)

You can find them on his google drive here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CRfZzn1fWJRCOf2g5-2q_jkC8nbM9u04?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CRfZzn1fWJRCOf2g5-2q_jkC8nbM9u04?usp=sharing)

I of course have made a copy for archival purposes which can be found here: [Roll20 Files](/files/Roll20sheet.zip)
