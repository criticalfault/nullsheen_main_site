After doing a lot of thinking about this little side project of mine, I had decided I perhaps needed to begin to supplement the cost of this website/hosting for tools/investment of time. I hate to make any kind of clutter or cause anyone any strife when it comes to reading my articles, using my tools, or just generally enjoying the spirit of the reason my site exists. However, seeing the cost continue to rise, I will need to come up with something.

My first thought was Ads, but man they made the website look TERRIBLE and in general, they earn next to nothing (After a week I made a dime, at their rate, it would be 2027 before I got my first check from Google.). Part of this is because this is SUCH a niche site, so it's not getting a ton of traffic. Another is because they require people to actually want whats in the ads being displayed. In general, this doesn't happen often.

So I've researched and discovered a 2nd option. Amazon links. So going forward, I will throw out some suggestions to the readers on what I recommend to purchase. Most of this will of course be Shadowrun, but may be dice, crafting materials, etc. If you are interested in picking some stuff up, sweet. Thanks! If not, its no big deal, it will just be another link you can scroll past.

So for instance, here are a few Shadowrun 3rd Edition books you can still buy on Amazon:
 - [SR3 Core](https://amzn.to/3WFuueI)
 - [Matrix](https://amzn.to/4amN9z5)
 - [Target: Matrix](https://amzn.to/3wu01Wp) 
 - [Man and Machine](https://amzn.to/4awBnm0)

I will be scattering these through out my older posts for books i used for those posts. I hope that will feel much more "cozy" and unforced. I apologize for anyone who was turned off by the ads I had temporarly on the site. I was seeing if they would help, they did more damage than good.
