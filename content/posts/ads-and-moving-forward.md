After doing a lot of thinking about this little side project of mine, I had decided I perhaps needed to begin to supplement the cost of this website/hosting for tools/investment of time. I hate to make any kind of clutter or cause anyone any strife when it comes to reading my articles, using my tools, or just generally enjoying the spirit of the reason my site exists. However, seeing the cost continue to rise, I think this may be the only real solution.

I had put out a Ko-Fi support link, but it had only been used twice. Once by a friend who helped me set it up and another for art I generated for anothers game. So unfortunately, it wasn't really putting a dent in the costs. That being said, Ads don't really do much either as I am seeing it, but I have only just began. So i'm going to give it around 3 months. See if it does what I need it too and then if it does, see if i can tune it down to be a bit less obnoxious in breaking up my nice and clean template.

I do want to say these ads will only be on my writing content. I will not be including them on any tools I make. So feel confident that you won't have to dodge ads on any of the Matrix Generators, Initaitive Trackers or Character Generators. Those will remain stand alones and will be away from the main content. Though I may one day look into turning them into an app one day. I don't really have any experience in handling something like that. So we will see. If I do i will keep the ones on the websites as they are.

Finally, I have hired on some help to get the character generator looking cleaner and being more mobile friendly. Design has never been my strong suit so hopefully this will mean we can have some dual development. Where I continue to advance the generators and keep the development moving swiftly along. It is my dream to one day be able to move over to this website and its content full time. I'd love to continue to craft new systems, stories and tools to everyone that ever wanted to feel like an unsung hero of the Shadows. If you do have any ideas for new tools or needs, just let me know. I'll be glad to see if I can get some time to put something together for you. All the tools I have on the site are there because someone asked about them.
