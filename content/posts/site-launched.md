# Starting Fresh
After doing a lot of game play for a group of friends and getting back into the community at large. I (and some friends) have decided to make a space for tools and things we have ended up writing for the Shadowrun (2nd and 3rd) systems. This will start out pretty small, but hopefully will have a lot of helpful stuff for people in need for tools for randomization or just in need of being able to put together systems for their games. Anything that gives a player or GM more control over their game and lets them run the game they want to run is my aim.

If anything jumps out to you as "Wow! This is great!" just let us know. The more encouragement I get, the better the chances are that more gets written.

Thanks for finding us. Game on Chummer.
