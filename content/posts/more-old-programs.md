After doing some more networking, some folks have come forward with more programs to be archived. 

* The source for [CCOC](/files/ccoc-161.zip) (The cyberdeck creator). 
* A [Name generator](/files/GameName.7z) (Which is just neat)
* [Jackpoints Software Suite](Jackpoint_Beta2_Redux_Setup.zip) (This is incredible!)
* [Timestamp Generator](/files/Timestamps.zip) (This makes those cool timestamps seen in a lot of source material)

I've linked these to the software page as well. I'm always excited to see more of these tools preserved. Even more so to put them altogether. I hope we can continue to grow these tools. It seems to have become my ultimate goal to reproduce a lot of these tools online, so folks won't need to install old software anymore and to keep them alive in the long term.

If you know of any tools I haven't cataloged and preserved. PLEASE reach out to me.
