This question is more common for new players than most GMs realize. Without classes and sets of specific dynamics to choose from, some players (especially those from games like Dungeons and Dragons) have a hard time understanding what kind of character to put together and that makes character creation overall much more difficult. I’m going to lay out some old school archetypes for you and what the perks are for trying to fit that role. This discussion should be more or less edition agnostic, so from 1st to 6th, this should get you going.

Be sure to check out my [software section](/software) to find various character builders. This will make your life so much easier!

## High Level Archetypes
Shadowrun divides mostly into 6 archetypes (What some would call classes). These aren't very restrictive but in general require either a specific kind of gear or some quality/choice is required in order to go down that path.

### Mage
Hermetic Mages are part of the newly awakened world of Shadowrun. Their magic stems from quantified theories of mana manipulation and mathematically sound sigils and forms. Mages require a library in order to continue their studies and are required to study in order to advance.

Mages can conjure elementals to provide them with extra spiritual power. Elementals stay in the astral until they are needed, which is good because they take hours to conjure. They stick around until their favors are expended. It is terrifying to run into a mage for them to speak a word and have 4 fire elemental manifest in front of them to rush the group.  

You can play casters that are either support characters, healers or full on combat mages. 

### Shaman
Shamonic casters draw their magic from powerful spiritual beings. Each shaman is dedicated to a specific spirit called Totems. Those spirits range from animal spirits, to Loa in Voodoo, or Orishas in Santeria.  Whereas Mages require a library in order to learn and advance, Shamans have to create “lodges” which is any kind of sacred space dedicated to the Totem they have as a patron. 

Shamans can conjure natural spirits or spirits from their specific path. These spirits are conjured as needed and only stick around for a short amount of time. They are also limited in freedoms to the “domain” they are summoned in, but can be summoned on the fly. 

You can play casters that are either support characters, healers or full on combat mages. Just make sure to match your totem to get the most of what role you want to play.

### Hacker/Decker
One of the principal aspects of Cyberpunk has always been those who can dive into computers and fight in virtual reality. Shadowrun has several flavors of this archetype but when it comes down to it, you have some kind of computer or phone and are on the team to secure communications, unlock doors, crack passwords and turn off auto guns and the like.

This is one of the professions that changes greatly between editions. Earlier editions you will be running small mini games in order to affect the real world. In later additions you will be on the street having to make line of sight with what you want to hack. Check with your GM on what Hackers/Deckers are like in the edition you are running. Regardless of editions, having someone who knows tech inside and out is ALWAYS welcome. You can read more about [being a decker here](https://www.nullsheen.com/posts/dumb-matrix-tricks/)

### Rigger
Your dreams of building the batmobile are just a few character creation choices away. Riggers are the masters of the road and the skies. They command vehicles by becoming the vehicle through a special Cyberware called a VCR (Vehicle Control Rig). This allows them to project their consciousness directly into the vehicle which allows them to make vehicles perform death defying stunts and maneuvers. This however is terribly expensive, so money will always be the limit to your riggers arsenal. 

Riggers come in two flavors, Vehicle Riggers and Drone Riggers. Vehicle riggers tend to focus on one or two vehicles and customize them to the max. Drone riggers focus on buying smaller vehicles and remotely control them like RC cars. If the drone rigger has a VCR, they can also throw their consciousness into the drone itself. Both require workshops and vehicle building and repairing skills, but if you want the flavor of wrenching on vehicles and pushing them to the limits. This is the archetype for you.

### Physical Adept
Magic comes in a few flavors, but one of them is pushing your body to new found limits and beyond. Following the way of ninja, monks or some other mystical tradition, Physical Adepts often learn martial arts to center themselves and to keep themselves safe on the streets. They can usually hold their own even against Street Samurai but for them it takes years of practice and of course being born partially awakened.  With enough time and effort they can one day even outperform the best cyberware on the market. Though doing so takes a long time!

One advantage that PA’s have above their Street Samurai cousins is access to some powers that they can only dream about. Being able to run across leaves on the water, strike spirits with their bare hands and have the ability to wield magical weapons (called Weapon Foci). Play a Physical Adept if you are looking for a mystical journey in the shadows looking for a deeper meaning to it all.

### The Face / Fixer
When it comes to running the shadows, who you know is who you are. The Face is the social grease the character needs in order to get the best deal, find the best weapons and be able to worm their way into places they shouldn't be with a smile and an enciting word. The Face often comes to bare with a dozen friends in places that can either get the word out or find out who is talking about whatever it is the shadowrunners need to know about. 

This profession changes the least between editions and in general is always useful support in any game. You will usually be leaned on to help procure weapons, ammo and vehicles when needed. Part of the fun is always having "just the right person" to talk too when you need something very specific. Buy a lot of contacts and ask your GM what would be most useful to get the most out of playing the face.

### Street Samurai
When it comes down to it, modifying your flesh and pushing yourself to the very edge of humanity through cybernetic enhancements is about as cyberpunk as it gets. The flesh is weak, but metal is perfection. Street Sams are the mercs on the street willing to run the shadows to test their skills against the best. When possible they continue to modify themselves in order to maintain their edge. In Shadowrun Reflexes are what separates the dead and the living. Wired Reflexes are the edge most Samurai go for. In earlier editions this allowed them to act multiple times before some people can even reach for their weapon. 

Being a street sam is about maintaining that edge and being able to find worthy opponents to face. Play a street sam if you want to be ronin wandering the street looking for cash for your next big upgrade.
