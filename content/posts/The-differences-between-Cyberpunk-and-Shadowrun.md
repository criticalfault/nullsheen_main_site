In the vast and complex landscape of cyberpunk fiction, two prominent universes have captured the imaginations of fans worldwide: Cyberpunk and Shadowrun. While both exist within the gritty, neon-lit framework of cyberpunk, they diverge significantly in their themes, with Cyberpunk focusing on legacy, and Shadowrun focusing on the living. I hope to highlight how each universe uniquely defines the essence of its characters and the worlds they inhabit and why this matters to you and your game.

Spoilers for Both the Shadowrun Metaplot, Edge Runners and some amount of Cyberpunk 2020/2070 Lore.

## Cyberpunk – A Legacy Etched on Neon in Blood

The Cyberpunk RPG universe is fundamentally about the legacies characters leave behind. In this world, recognition often comes posthumously. Characters navigate a brutal, high-tech society where what truly makes them matter is what they do with their final breath. The Afterlife bar stands as a symbol of this. A shrine really, where only the most legendary are remembered, celebrated in death and the legacy left behind.

The narrative arcs of Cyberpunk characters focuses on the idea that true impact is achieved through one's final act, often at the cost of their life. Characters strive for a place in history, knowing that their stories will be told and retold only after they are gone. This pursuit of legacy is a driving force, propelling characters into actions that ensure their names are etched into the neon-lit annals of cyberpunk history. Each time remembered, as those who come after sip the drinks of those namesakes lost, remembering and trying to decide what they are willing to die for.

## Shadowrun – Fate protects those who live for Good in a World of Evil.

Shadowrun is a universe where survival is the central figure. It's a world where doing good is not just a moral choice but ultimately a survival strategy. Shadowrunners navigate a complex web of corporate intrigue, magic, and technology, where the line between right and wrong is often blurred, but the concept of karma is central to this universe—those who consistently do good, even in the shadows, find themselves miraculously surviving situations that should have been their end.

Shadowrun emphasizes the importance of actions taken in the here-and-now. Characters are often judged by their ability to endure and continue making a difference, rather than the legacy they leave behind. The meta plot celebrates those who fight against the worst odds, but do so because it’s the right thing to do. These are the people who have seen the worst aspects of the world, and even the hells of the spirit world, and keep coming back.  

## Examples
### Died for what they believed in:
#### [Sasha Yakovleva](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Sasha_Yakovleva)
Was willing to stay behind in a run because she discovered that the corp that made the medicine her mother took when she was sick had a known side effect that led to her death. She wasn’t willing to live in a world where this could happen to someone else and fought to the death to leak this information to the media in order to keep it from happening to another person.
This is one of the most compelling stories I've ever seen in short form. The first time I saw it I could hardly believe it and it brought tears to my eyes. Seriously, go watch it: [https://youtu.be/BnnbP7pCIvQ](https://youtu.be/BnnbP7pCIvQ)

#### [David Martinez](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/David_Martinez)
After the edge runners had begun to make a name for themselves and become established, David began to move to the edge. After making a powerful enemy and getting in over his head, he had to make a decision when the trap was sprung. In the end he decided that he was willing to give his life so Lucy could live hers. He died and gave it all to ensure that his love and his friends might live another day.

#### [Johnny Silverhand](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Johnny_Silverhand) 
Johnny had always lived on the edge, but he fell in love with Alt Cunningham while edge running. She unfortunately had an addiction that even Johnny didn’t fully understand. She was obsessed with the idea of AI and transhumanism. She spent all of her time developing a program for this process for [ITS](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/ITS). That program was then used to create the infamous [SoulKiller](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Soulkiller)  program. Arasaka wanted this tech for themselves so they kidnapped her to force her into recreating this software from memory. This was what led to the infamous Arasaka Tower encounter and ultimately, what led to the time of the Red. Johnny wasn’t willing to let Arasaka win. He was willing to sacrifice everything to save Alt and though it’s not known who triggered the bomb ultimately. I firmly believe Johnny would have pulled the trigger himself if he had the option.

### Lived so they can continue the fight:
#### [Captain Chaos](https://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Chaos)
Perhaps the most well known Decker in Shadowrun, the man who runs the Denver Data Haven had survived more attempts on his life along with several cataclysms. His pursuit to make sure people have the REAL truth of the matter behind just about everything. He has fought against Deus, Rogue Otaku and one of two Matrix Crashes. Even after the Matrix Crash 2.0 that destroyed the Captain’s Body, he continues his fight, now not in his body, but his ghost in the machine. 

#### [Ghost-Who-Walks-Inside](https://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/Ghost_Who_Walks_Inside)
A legendary street samurai, Ghost has been involved in dozens of Shadowruns that have shaped the world we live in. He was part of the original Shadowrun crew (Alongside Dodger and Sally Tsung). He fought Renraku, Dragons and pretty much everything that the shadows could throw at him. He is a no-nonsense runner, but continues to survive in the shadows by sticking to his code.

#### [Harlequin](https://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/Harlequin)
One of the heroes of legend, Harley has been fighting for (meta)humanity for literally thousands of years. Fate (and thus Karma really) has not only kept him alive but ensured he was placed in specific places at specific times to ensure he could pass on whatever knowledge or aid needed to keep humanity going. His magic and nearly mad insights have saved not only this world but hundreds of others when the call came. When he shows up, something massive is brewing.

## Conclusion

Both Cyberpunk and Shadowrun offer rich, immersive experiences within the cyberpunk genre, but they do so through different lenses. By understanding these thematic differences, we can appreciate the unique narratives each universe offers, enriching their experience of the cyberpunk game you’re running or playing in. Whether it's the neon-lit legacy left by Edgerunners or the enduring fight for survival in Shadowrun, both worlds offer compelling insights into what it means to make a difference in a dystopian future. 

What are your thoughts on this? Do you believe that the only way to make a difference is in dying for what you believe in? Is living what you believe in just as meaningful? Why do the deaths of those who went down fighting hurt us so deeply but keep us coming back for more? Why does [Mike Pondsmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pondsmith) always introduce himself as [“The guy who killed your Cyberpunk character”](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxllYuozHma5zVRJ7uUJxkDt_P6E9KfokQ?si=HYCY03WpRKRkD7Gt)?!
