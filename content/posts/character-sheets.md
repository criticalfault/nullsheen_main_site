After doing some digging into character sheets for an up and coming game. I suddenly realize the crap shoot that was finding character sheets for Shadowrun. On one hand, it makes sense. The IP has been shared and scattered to the winds across half a dozen companies all keeping their own digital presence. On the other, we used to have things like dumpshock.org to keep us with what we needed. Nowadays, well it's a whole different ball game. I think it's time to change that. One place, all the sheets you'll ever need.

These sheets all have their own trademarks but are also free to distribute if you're not making coin on it and I for one and not making a dime!

    - This is a sheet collection I've sworn by my whole Shadowrun career. Made by [Wordman](https://rpg.divnull.com/srun/). A legend in the Shadows. I'm linking his site for the moment (though it appears to be untouched since its golden age). If he gives me direct permission. I'll host his files here as well.

- [4th Edition Character Sheets](https://www.gamingverse.com/shadowrun/sheets.html)
    - Following Wordman's path. Jhaiisiin created the 4th edition version. Same thing with Wordman's files. Once I hear from Jhaiisiin, then I'll host their files on this site as well.

If you have any old sheets we can host, shoot me an email. I'd love to gather some more SR Materials for safe keeping. Keep to the shadows runners.
