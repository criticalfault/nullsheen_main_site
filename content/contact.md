Are you passionate about digital preservation? Do you possess software tools that once played a pivotal role at your table or other creative endeavors you want preserved? If so, I’m eager to connect with you. My mission is to archive essential tools before they vanish into history. Along this journey, I’ve met several individuals who share this vision. They are the custodians of software that, though no longer available, once laid the groundwork for innovation and eased the burdens of GMs.

Together, we celebrate the dedication and ingenuity of those who developed these tools. Each application has not only facilitated the creation of a game but has also enhanced the creative process in many ways.

## Reach Out and Preserve History

If you have tools or software you believe should be archived, please don’t hesitate to contact me at dean@nullsheen.com. If you’re seeking to develop a tool, I'm open to discussing its potential. The feasibility will depend on it's utility and the investment of time it requires. Let’s explore how we can collaborate to keep these important resources accessible.

I look forward to connecting with you and preserving our digital heritage.

-Dean, Unofficial Shadowrun Archivist
