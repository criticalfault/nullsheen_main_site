As I continue on with this site, I stumble across all kinds of things I want archived. I hope that this archive out survives me and that we can preserve things that would once be just a figment in someones memory for those who have yet to pick up a Shadowrun book. This is all done in that effort, to make a preserved snap shot of the world as we knew it when we first began our own journeys. If you have anything that you think is worth preserving, send it my way. I'll be more than happy to host it as I am able.
