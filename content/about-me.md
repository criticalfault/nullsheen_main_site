About Dean
Professional Programmer & Shadowrun Enthusiast

Hello! I'm Dean, a seasoned programmer with nearly a decade of experience crafting dynamic web solutions using PHP, JavaScript, and Python. I earned my stripes in Web Development from Full Sail University, where I honed my skills and developed a deep understanding of the digital landscape.

Programming is more than just a job for me; it's a platform that allows me to blend my technical skills with my personal passions. Since the 1990s, I've been an avid player and game master of Shadowrun, beginning with the 2nd edition and finding a special place in my heart for the 3rd edition. This long-standing engagement with the world of Shadowrun led me to develop tools designed to enhance the gaming experience for players worldwide. My work aims to preserve the rich history of the game while facilitating smoother, more engaging gameplay.

When I'm not coding or rolling dice, I'm exploring new technologies and continuously looking for ways to push the boundaries of what I can create. Whether it's developing software or crafting the next great gaming tool, I am always driven by my passion for creating and sharing.

Let's Connect

Whether you're interested in discussing programming, Shadowrun, or just looking to connect, I'm always open to new ideas and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at dean@nullsheen.com.

I look forward to hearing from you and exploring what we can create together.
