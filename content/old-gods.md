Welcome to the dark hollers and haunted hills of Appalachia. Based on the hit podcast, Old Gods of Appalachia brings cosmic horror to the mountains using the Cypher System.

## 📖 Game Review

**[Old Gods of Appalachia Review](/posts/old-gods-of-appalachia-review/)** - My full review of the game system, setting, and what makes it special

## 🎲 Tools & Resources

- **[Old Gods of Appalachia - Folk Magic](/posts/old-gods-of-appalachia-folk-magic/)** - My thoughts on how folk magic system might work
- **[Old Gods of Appalachia - Subtle Cyphers](/files/SubtleCyphers.pdf)** - My attempt to make subtle cyphers for non magical characters for Old Gods. This will allow the magical people to have more magic and non-magical people have more cinematic cyphers. Most of these are from CSR (See below) but a few were my own. This is made to be print friendly, cut up and use at the table!
